This document outlines the coding standards and practices.

## Commenting

- Write clear, concise English comments that state high-level purpose, long-term rationale, and expected behavior (“why”) independent of variable names or implementation details.
- Document assumptions, side effects, limitations, and any non-obvious logic that benefits from additional context.
- Add comments when code intention or behavior isn’t immediately clear from names and structure.

## Tools

- Use rg for grepping
- Use fd for finding files
- Use fzf for fuzzy finder
- Use hyperfine for benchmarking
