# gen-conventional-commits-message.md

- Generate a commit message based on previous implementations or changes in the conventional commits format

- The requirement is to show the commit message only, NEVER git operations.

- Keep in your mind that the commit message will be shown in the release notes, so it should be clear and concise.

- Even if you write codes under some plan that has some phases, NEVER include the phase information in the commit message.
